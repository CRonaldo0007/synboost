# Semantic Segmentation Uncertainty Estimation
This repository tackles uncertainty estimation for semantic segmentation using visual dissimilarity. The project is a 
continuation of the work presented by [1] and it relates to my master thesis in the Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL) 
at ETH Zurich. 

### Installation

In order to set-up the project, please follow these steps:
1) Run  `git clone https://github.com/giandbt/driving_uncertainty.git. 
2) Download pre-trained models for CC-FPSE [2] 
(https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1m4JMtKLDfcXCW1HXHKz-fP6y3_SAaUqX&export=download) 
and DeepLabV3+ with WiderResNet38 [3] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P4kPaMY-SmQ3yPJQTJ7xMGAB_Su-1zTl/view).
3) Install all the neccesary python modules with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
